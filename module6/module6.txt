Database Creation

	To create a new database in MySQL, use the CREATE DATABASE statement.
		CREATE DATABASE company_db;

To use the newly created database, use the USE statement:
	USE company_db;


Table Creation
	To create a table, use the CREATE TABLE statement. Let's create a table for employees.

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    job_title VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

Adding a Primary Key
	In the table creation step above, we have already added a primary key to the id column using the PRIMARY KEY constraint.


Modifying the Table Structure
	To modify the structure of an existing table, use the ALTER TABLE statement. Let's add a new column for the hire date.

	ALTER TABLE employees
	ADD hire_date DATE;

Inserting Values into Your Table
	To insert values into the table, use the INSERT INTO statement.

	INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email, job_title, salary, hire_date)
	VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', 'Software Engineer', 60000.00, '2023-01-15');

Inserting Values in a Specific Column

	If you want to insert values into specific columns, you can omit the columns not being inserted.

		INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email)
		VALUES ('Jane', 'Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com');

Updating Records

	To update existing records, use the UPDATE statement. Let's update John's salary.

		UPDATE employees
		SET salary = 65000.00
		WHERE first_name = 'John' AND last_name = 'Doe';

Updating Multiple Columns

	To update multiple columns at once, list all columns to be updated.

		UPDATE employees

		SET job_title = 'Senior Software Engineer', salary = 70000.00
		WHERE first_name = 'John' AND last_name = 'Doe';

Using Select Statements

	To retrieve data from the table, use the SELECT statement.
		SELECT * FROM employees;

		SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM employees WHERE job_title = 'Software Engineer';

Deleting Columns

	To delete a column from a table, use the ALTER TABLE statement with the DROP COLUMN clause.

		ALTER TABLE employees
		DROP COLUMN hire_date;

Deleting All Data in a Table

	To delete all data in a table without removing the table itself, use the TRUNCATE TABLE statement.
		TRUNCATE TABLE employees;

Deleting a Table

	To delete a table, use the DROP TABLE stateme
		DROP TABLE employees;


Deleting a Database

	To delete an entire database, use the DROP DATABASE statement.
		DROP DATABASE company_db;
